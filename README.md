# "Tic Tac Toe" with patterns

Simple game implementation using common programming patters.

## Used design patterns

* Builder - for creating board printers with custom settings
* Decorator - printers extends boards functionality (adds ability to print them)
* RAII - board manages dynamic memory for storing cells and frees it on destruction
* ... - more will be implemented soon
